Eigen Games:

Initial Prompt:

Here is what I am thinking: I will make a platform that people go to and ask for assistance or something of the like. People ill come and ask if it can make flashcards and give the criteria, then if the solution exists, it will show it directly to the user, and it will add the user to a group of similar tasked people that need similar or tangential/parralel types of service. If it not made a soluton yet, ai will refine their idea, confirm it with them, the add it to another section that is for underdevelopment. and once made it will notfy the users in need of that specific model and allow them to test it for free and get feedback, then once finalized it . It will be a service priced based on the service and market (it should be adaptive). So help me outline this
